## Activity 0 - Prerequisites and Recommendations

### Purpose

The purpose of this activity is to for you to ensure you have Windows environment that is compatible with the list of 10 activities described in this document (and to save you a lot of time if your environment isn't compatible).  

### Goals, Non-Goals and Assumptions

The goal of this activity is to inform you about the minimum and recommended pre-requisites for successful execution of the remaining acitivities in Quick Start Process Guide for Windows .NET Developers.

### Principles

* Provide reliable documentation TODO reference
* Save as much of a person's time as possible

### Drivers

* Lack of an existing set of concise and easy to follow documentation

## Prerequisites and Recommendations

The basic hardware and software prerquisites are that you have a computer (PC or laptap) with:
* Microsoft Windows 10 operating system (any edition - Home or Pro or Academic)
* Latest Windows Updates installed
* 8GB of RAM (16GM or more prefered because you need to install and enable the Hyper-V feature and service)
* 50GB of free disk space (100GB ore preferred because you will eventually have multiple copies of the NEO blockchain files downloaded on to your machine)
* An SSD (solid state drive) is preferred over a conventional hard drive (HDD) for perfomance reasons but it's not a necessity

The activities in this document were tested on two configurations:
* Windows 10 Home edition HP laptop, 8GB RAM, 1TB HDD, Intel i5 processor
* Windows 10 Pro edition Levnovo laptop, 32GB RAM, 500GB SSD + 500GB HDD, Intel i7 processor
