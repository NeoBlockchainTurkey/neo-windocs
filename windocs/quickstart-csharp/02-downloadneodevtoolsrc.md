## Download and unpack NEO development tool sources

While Activity 1 - Download and install Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition integrated development environment (IDE) is completing, proceed to download and unpack the following 2 NEO Project projects to help you save time.

**NOTE:** Rather than downloading the source archive files, you may choose to `git clone` each of the 2 projects.  I leave that up to you. I'm just trying to keep things as simple as 

### Neon MSIL Transcompiler

1. Visit the Neon Neo transcompiler Github project at [https://github.com/neo-project/neo-compiler](https://github.com/neo-project/neo-compiler).

2. Click `Clone or Download` and then select `Download ZIP` to download an archive of the current version of the project's source code to your local NEO folder (i.e. `C:\NEO` or your alternate folder created in Activity 0 - Prerequisites and Recommendations).

3. Unzip the archive file to save the source files into the subfolder (e.g. by default `C:\NEO\neo-compiler-master`).

### Neo-Gui-Developer Node/Wallet

4. Visit the Neon Neo transcompiler Github project at [https://github.com/neo-project/neo-compiler](https://github.com/neo-project/neo-compiler).
