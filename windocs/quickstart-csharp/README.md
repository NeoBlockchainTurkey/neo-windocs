# NEO Blockchain Quick Start Process Guide for .NET Developers

NEO Blockchain documentation for .NET Developers ([url](https://github.com/mwherman2000/neo-windocs/tree/master/windocs))

## Purpose

The purpose of this document is to enable .NET developers who are brand new to NEO Blockchain technology to create a useful NEO development environent up and running in as little time as possible.

## Goals

* Ensure you have a working and properly configured NEO development environment up and running in as short a time as possible
* Enable to create, deploy and test your first NEO smart contract written in C# (using the HelloWorld sample)

## Principles

* Provide reliable documentation: timely, accurate, visual, and complete
* Save as much of a person's time as possible
* Use free software whenever possible

## Drivers

* Need in the Neo .NET developer community to have concise and easy-to-follow documentation to enable people to get up to speed developing NEO smart contracts in as short a time as possible
