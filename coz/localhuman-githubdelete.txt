https://github.com/neo-project/neo/issues/128

I was unaware of this issue but I have already implemented a solution for this in the NEO Persisted Classes Platform 2.1. The relavent features are:

NPC Entity and Domain Model
NPC Structured Storage Model
NPC NeoStorageKey Specification
NEO-KONG (Key-Object Notation for Geeks)

The most condensed explanation I have available today isn't very condensed. Check out NEO Persistable Classes (NPC) Platform 2.0: Deep Dive. WARNING: It's 100 minutes long.

If you want a shorter introduction (that doesn't cover the above capabilities), check out 12. NEO Persistable Classes (NPC) Platform 2.1: Preview (35 minutes).
