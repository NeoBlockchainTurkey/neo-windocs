@canesin and I ended up at the Boston Blockchain Reserve meetup last night. We fielded questions for about an hour then Da joined the Meetup via a live Skype call. #awesome-neo evening and #afterparty

Caterina Zhang - Yesterday at 8:56 AM
I didn’t know that you and Fabio were there at the event..it should be good enough to have you two there introducing about neo.
Hope the Skype quality was good.

Michael Herman (Toronto) - Yesterday at 9:22 AM
Da came across very well using Skype

awesome @Blockcamp .. :smiley: ..
@Caterina Zhang I was not planning to, as I was not aware. It ended as a last minute thing

canesin - Yesterday at 3:37 PM
Also, I told to you in private @Michael Herman (Toronto)  .. but I will express publicly to be clear: It is not okay to brand yourself "from" CoZ, highjack a random Meetup and say stuff atop a chair. You have energy and that is awesome, but you made no real contribution to the project still, a handful of examples and creating meetings in a website doesn't give you credentials to speak for hundreds of people on charge of billions in assets.
@Caterina Zhang I really dislike how you are conducting this hacktons, we have plenty of rushed events that are not outputing more than script kiddies, this kind of things need proper planning to bring results - the other way they just overwork people and frustrate potential contributors with the experience, we are loosing good developers, not winning then.

@canesin I'm an all-in or all-out type of person in terms of my passion and energy and capabilities. You made no effort to understand that Da was speaking in your own city. I drove 9 hours from Toronto to be in Boston just for that meeting. I didn't expect to be involved or become involved. John, the organizer,  was overflowing with his appreciation that we were both there.   As I told you,  I love my new roles. ...and I have decades of experience to support them. If for whatever reasons this is too much of a burden for you, that can change in a microsecond. What do you want?
@Caterina Zhang Boston was an enormously powerful event. From the questions we heard as well as the advance questions sent to Da by the organizer, there is clearly an enormous amount of FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt) in the USA, in particular, about NEO. Simple things like hearing and seeing real people being passionate about the platform and the Smart Economy, knowing about all the countries being visited in the next couple months, the size of the Microsoft contest, NEO's careful and well-thought out strategies for growth and decentralization, the communities, the ecosystems, ...  Yesterday evening was a huge success and represents an opportunity for NEO to make further inroads with John and his group of 546 members.

@Michael Herman (Toronto) you have no idea the efforts that fabio has made -- his efforts have made your ability to even talk with us here possible. please be more respectful. he is simply asking that you do not speak for CoZ, as you are not in a position to speak for CoZ -- it is as simple as that

Michael Herman (Toronto) - Yesterday at 6:12 PM
@unignorant This isn't a problem. I can speak entirely from a personal perspective going forward. How I am able to contribute and the magnitude of those contributions doesn't hinge on being a member of CoZ ...it has to be a comfortable relationship for everyone.

canesin - Yesterday at 6:26 PM
@Michael Herman (Toronto) you are wrong in all aspects and you tone down. I had a meeting yesterday that I lost, Da was not speaking was a Skype call, do you think I track his Skype calls ? I ended loosing the game theory group poker night with top VCs and Blockchain people from the region, a event much more important. It was not enormously powerful, it was not even powerful - it was okay, for about 45 people with a dude that didn't knew about NEO at all. But this is not about that and that is why I didn't bring it up, is about the posture you had. If you don't know how to work in a open source project, yes - it does hinge your contributions and magnitude of those.
this is not a discussion, is a informing.

unignorant - Yesterday at 6:30 PM
@Michael Herman (Toronto) in general the way we operate here is to make contributions instead of talking about making contributions -- the fact that this idea comes up, and that we are having this conversation is a problem. that said, i hope you stick around and contribute some great work!
Michael Herman (Toronto) - Yesterday at 6:35 PM
You have seen my contributions and will continue to see them ...CoZ or no CoZ, I'm sticking around for the long haul.
@canesin I see you meant Bye in a serious way.

canesin - Yesterday at 7:15 PM
yes, very sad - in thousands of people and 1 year is the first time someone loses the access. I will try to understand how this come to be so that this is not just the first but last time this happens.

Caterina Zhang - Yesterday at 8:05 PM
@canesin i was told it is an opening event of a wework space specialized in blockchain. It is not worthwhile to have both Da and you to present at such small and first time event. They’ve over consuming our people. Da has a super over-loaded schedule and it is not always realistic to have him call in at last minute in an early early morning.
From neo team side we have limited knowledge of this community in Boston. Hope to see what future activities they do in the field.

totalvamp - Yesterday at 8:11 PM
@Caterina Zhang however thst doesn't explain how we went from 3 events we organised and Da was attending none are left. It's not good to keep changing schedules last minute constantly, not only does it gives us major headaches but it also suggests that we don't know what we are doing.
Also to keep requesting CoZ council members to present at hackathons which hinders our progress on other things significantly.
Events like these are supposed to be done months ahead not weeks.

Caterina Zhang - Yesterday at 8:13 PM
Which 3 events？

totalvamp - Yesterday at 8:13 PM
For example the Sydney event, we had Da coming there and had that arranged well ahead, but all of a sudden Da has to attend in Korea.

Michael Herman (Toronto) - Yesterday at 8:19 PM
@canesin Sorry to hear your commercial/VC meetings didn't go well Fabio.  What do they have to do with this discussion?
