@Michael Herman (Toronto) was good to know you yesterday, thanks for the :beer:.
I have to say something to you: you can't identity yourself as a CoZ developer or speek for CoZ yet, there is a process for this and you should pass through it like everyone else... Is exactly like the rewards, just take your time to prove yourself. I'm sure you will have no problems with it, but I believe that you know now, there is no exceptions and everyone gets the same treatment.
So for the sake of correctness call yourself CoZ contributor for the time being, and remind it is your personal opinions when speaking. Remember, CoZ is a foundation and we can't legally be responsible for people ideas.

Got it. Thank you:grinning: :flag_ca:

:smile:

Michael Herman (Toronto) - Yesterday at 2:11 PM
I really did. I'm looking forward to hosting Toronto and Vancouver. Then workshops/presentations in Turkey, Ukraine, Bulgaria and Israel.
FYHumor: Maybe I'll have to brand myself as an AND?
Awesome NEO Developer :wink:

canesin - Yesterday at 3:29 PM
you are not a NEO developer also, nor awesome - you have to deserve this, not brand yourself.
baby steps
I starting to realize you don't understand the open source collab nature..
you should learn it..
observe the community
the key people, their conduct

Michael Herman (Toronto) - Yesterday at 6:28 PM
Why have you chosen to have this public feud? Kick me out of CoZ if that's what you want.

canesin - Yesterday at 6:29 PM
I do not want that
That is why I didn't do it

Michael Herman (Toronto) - Yesterday at 6:30 PM
What do you call the public criticism?

canesin - Yesterday at 6:30 PM
and again, you are a contributor .. you are not in CoZ
I called for your attitude as representative
think 30min
why I didn't identify myself with my credentials and what we are trying to build here
and it is not public
it is a selected group that can read that

Michael Herman (Toronto) - Yesterday at 6:33 PM
I won't mention CoZ again. It can be a totally background role that never needs mentioning. Is that OK? Is that what will make you happy?

canesin - Yesterday at 6:33 PM
no Michael, I think Ethan is on point - you don't understand at all.
I will take you never did open source before
and are not a good team worker

Michael Herman (Toronto) - Yesterday at 6:37 PM
Never worked well with authoritarian "figureheads" :wink: who value processes and bureaucracy more than tangible contributions.

canesin - Yesterday at 6:37 PM
you are cuco, I'm not even your boss - bye.
