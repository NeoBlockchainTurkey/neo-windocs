@Michael Herman (Toronto) you have been informed on coz_general that you where not a CoZ developer, than multiple times on DMs and even so you continue to identity yourself as one and include it on your presentations, I'm very saddened to have to do this but your position is beyond absurd. You never have been a CoZ developer, all you did was have access to private discord, something that is the first small step. You didn't do any contribution to CoZ during the short period you had access. So don't make me do a wide warning and please correct your repositories and public use of CoZ name.(edited)

@canesin On Feb. 19, 2018 I was invited to become a CoZ Developer by @ashant and he suggested the title/role was "CoZ Developer" https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwherman2000/neo-csharpcoe/master/images/ashant-invitation.png.  He also approved the changes I made to my LinkedIn profile.  I have since changed my profile and other references to reflect that I am an "Independent Blockchain Developer" that has and continues to contribute to a number of NEO and CoZ projects: neo-lux, neo-debugger-tools and neo-gui-developer.(edited)
Here are some examples of where I describe my current role: https://github.com/mwherman2000/neo-csharpcoe/blob/master/README.md#who-is-michael-herman, https://www.linkedin.com/in/mwherman/ and https://github.com/mwherman2000/neo-csharpcoe/blob/master/events/2018-NEO-Blockchain-Toronto/NEO%20Blockchain-Toronto-20180314%20Meetup-WIPB.pdf(edited)

@Michael Herman (Toronto) that is a misnomer that @ashant had, the redirect is how we control access - that is why besides the redirect you where never able to send emails from it, real CoZ developers can. So to clarify once again to you and anyone reading this since you choose to confront once again instead of accept, @here to be considered a CoZ developer you have to be a member of CoZ GitHub organization, before it you are a contributor, in light of people using CoZ name to self-promotion even after warnings we decided to list all CoZ members and their roles in a upcoming update to CoZ website. Please if someone is using CoZ reputation to promote his project always check CoZ github members here: https://github.com/orgs/CityOfZion/people

@canesin Do you have any issues with the above 3 links? ...perhaps we should take this offline.(edited)

I will not discuss this again, we already discussed this offline several times, but you kept playing games to the absurd in DMs with others. Please remove any reference from CoZ in your material. This is my last friendly warning and is a shame it is public.
