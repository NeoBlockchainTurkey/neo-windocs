I have to thank again for the discussion Fabian.  Coupled with the long drive home, it was very liberating for me in terms of "seeing the path ahead" for what've embarked on and where it's headed. ...I just arrived back in Toronto.  I'll elaborate on this tomorrow.  Thk u.

The first thought that ran through my mind was what to do with the code/content/community I've created for C#.NEO developers?  Easy.  Create an umbrella project: 
NEO Blockchain C# Developer Center of Excellence (neo-csharpcoe) https://github.com/mwherman2000/neo-csharpcoe/blob/master/README.md
I was working towards this on CoZ.  In fact, I created an open issue for it: https://github.com/CityOfZion/awesome-neo/issues/64 ...but now that my contributions are neither appreciated nor valued.  I've been completely cut of from even submitting contribution reports as a non-CoZ developer.(edited)
But this is the liberating part ...why worry about a group that does appreciate or value my contributions ...when it is actually easier to build code, content and community on my own.
Which brings me to the second directly connected thought that (perhaps) CoZ should have considered.   Fabio's action to completely 100% remove me from CoZ to the point where I can't submit my weekly contribution report has had the effect of creating two parallel streams of effort in the NEO developer community.  Fabio has triggered a #hardfolk.  A #hardfolk in terms of code, content and community.   This is why I said yesterday (before I fully understood it myself) that it's going to be hard to come back into CoZ at a later date.(edited)
This was my drive home last night in a nutshell.(edited)
CoZ started with one person who had a great vision and mission ...neo-csharpcoe is starting out the same way.
