# neo-windocs

NEO Blockchain end-to-end, detailed guidance for .NET developers ([url](https://github.com/mwherman2000/neo-windocs))

This project contains content purposely designed to help .NET developers ramp up and become productive more quickly.

This project also serves as a repository for content presented at the [NEO Blockchain Toronto meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/NEO-Blockchain-Toronto/).

## NEO Blockchain Microsoft .NET Developer Content

* [NEO Blockchain Quick Start Guide for .NET developers](https://github.com/mwherman2000/neo-windocs/tree/master/windocs/quickstart-csharp)

The purpose of this document is to enable .NET developers who are brand new to NEO Blockchain technology to create a useful NEO development environment up and running in as little time as possible.

* [NEO Blockchain Architecture Reference Model for .NET Developers (neo-charm)](https://github.com/mwherman2000/neo-windocs/tree/master/windocs/neo-charm/README.md)

The purpose of this document is to document a (software) architecture reference model for the NEO Blockchain platform to enable .NET developers to become more knowledge about the NEO platform more quickly and more easily.

## NEO Blockchain Toronto Meetup Group

**[NEO Blockchain Toronto](https://www.meetup.com/NEO-Blockchain-Toronto/)** is a non-profit, community-based Meetup group for blockchain developers and architects interested in designing and creating Distributed Ledge Technology (DLT) (aka blockchain) solutions using the NEO Blockchain platform.

**[NEO](https://neo.org/)** is a non-profit, community-based blockchain project that utilizes blockchain technology and digital identity to digitize assets, to automate the management of digital assets using smart contracts, and to realize a "smart economy" with a distributed network.

This meetup is a group that it is currently independent of the official [NEO Project](https://github.com/neo-project) and [City of Zion](https://github.com/CityOfZion/) projects. I'm looking forward to this changing in the future.
