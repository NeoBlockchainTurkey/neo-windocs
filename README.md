## NEO Blockchain Toronto Meetup Group

NEO Blockchain Toronto is (primarily) for blockchain developers and architects interested in creating Distributed Ledge Technology (DLT) (aka blockchain) solutions based the NEO Blockchain platform.

NEO is a non-profit community-based blockchain project that utilizes blockchain technology and digital identity to digitize assets, to automate the management of digital assets using smart contracts, and to realize a "smart economy" with a distributed network. You can learn more about NEO here (https://neo.org/).

This meetup is a group that it is currently independent of the official NEO and City of Zion projects. I'm looking forward to this changing in the future.
