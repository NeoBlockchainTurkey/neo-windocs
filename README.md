NEO Blockchain end-to-end, detailed guidance for Microsoft .NET Developers [url](https://github.com/mwherman2000/neo-windocs)

This project contains content purposely designed to help Microsoft .NET developers ramp up and become productive more quickly.

This project also serves as a respository for content presented at the [NEO Blockchain Toronto meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/NEO-Blockchain-Toronto/).

## NEO Blockchain Toronto Meetup Group

[NEO Blockchain Toronto](https://www.meetup.com/NEO-Blockchain-Toronto/) is (primarily) for blockchain developers and architects interested in creating Distributed Ledge Technology (DLT) (aka blockchain) solutions based the NEO Blockchain platform.

NEO is a non-profit community-based blockchain project that utilizes blockchain technology and digital identity to digitize assets, to automate the management of digital assets using smart contracts, and to realize a "smart economy" with a distributed network. You can learn more about NEO here (https://neo.org/).

This meetup is a group that it is currently independent of the official [NEO Project](https://github.com/neo-project) and [City of Zion](https://github.com/CityOfZion/) projects. I'm looking forward to this changing in the future.
